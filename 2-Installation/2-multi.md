## Network Installation

Firstly install the *UltraPermissions.jar* on every Server including your BungeeCord.
In the next step, you have to enable MySQL for every Server via the intuitive interface.
<br />
Execute **/upc addSuperadmin (Your IGN)** via Console and then **/uperms** and navigate to *Settings > MySQL*.
Then enter your MySQL Credentials and restart the Server.
After you have repeated that process for every Server, Ultra Permissions should now be fully functional!
<br />
In the event that you create a new Server, just repeat the steps. The BungeeCord is configuring itself fully automatically
